*(Mimics the way an actual COO thinks — capacity, cost, risk, and opportunity.)*

### **1. Dispatched-to-Inbounds % by CBM**

**What does it mean**:  
Shows whether the warehouse is moving volume in line with incoming flow.</br>

**Why it matters**:  
- If dispatch < inbound, stock builds → capital gets stuck → storage pressure spikes.
- If dispatch > inbound, demand is outpacing supply → risk of stock-outs.

---

### **2. Inbound Value vs Dispatched Value**

**What does it mean**:  
Tracks the cost of goods arriving vs the cost of goods going out.

**Why it matters:**  
COO sees instantly whether cash is tied up, whether stock is aging, and whether procurement aligns with sales velocity.

---

### **3. Labour Efficiency (Inbound, Returns, Outbound)**

**Why it matters:** 
- Efficiency = cost per unit moved.
- Poor efficiency = margin bleed.
- Each function reveals different bottlenecks.

---

### **4. Shift Productivity (Inbound, Returns, Outbound)**

**Why it matters:**  
Shows whether shift managers are actually controlling output or simply babysitting bodies.

---

### **5. Avg. Task completion Cycle Time/s (Inbound, Returns, Outbound)**

**Why it matters:**
- Long cycle time = slow business.
- A COO sees this as **capacity loss**, not just delay.

---

### **6. On-Time Putaway % (Inbound, Returns)**

**Why it matters:**  
Delayed putaway → no stock for sales → lost revenue and buyer frustration.

---

### **7. On-Time-Dispatch %**

**Why it matters:**
- Direct customer experience KPI.
- COO sees this as brand reputation + cost of reattempts.

---

### **8. Resalable Returns %**

**Why it matters:**
- Higher resalable % = recovered value.
- Low % = pure margin loss + damage in operations or logistics.

---

### **9. Order Fulfillment %** *(Error-free outbound accuracy)*

**Why it matters:**
- Every mis-pick has a cost: transport, reprocessing, customer trust, GP loss.
- COO wants this near-perfect.

---

### **10. Lost GP Due to Failed Picks**

**What does it mean**:  
Direct money burnt because of outbound mistakes.

**Why it matters:**
- It’s not just a KPI — it’s a financial pain point.
- COOs treat this as “avoidable losses” that must trend down monthly.

---

### **11. Revenue & Profit**

**What does it mean**:  
The ultimate health bar.

**Why it matters:**  
- Revenue tells you activity; profit tells you whether that activity is even worth it.
- COOs watch for margin erosion through logistics inefficiency, returns, or GP leakage.

---

### **12. Warehouse Utilization %**

**Why it matters:**
- Under-utilization = wasted space.
- Over-utilization = congestion → cycle times explode → SLA failures.

---

### **13. Current Pallet Positions, CBM & Stock Value**

**What does it mean**:  
The real-time footprint of the business.

**Why it matters:**
- Space = money.
- Stock = risk.
- High inventory value with limited pallet positions/ CBM → instant need for space strategy or throughput acceleration.

---

### **14. Employee Age Distribution (Head count against Age Buckets)**

**What does it mean**:  
Workforce maturity snapshot.

**Why it matters:**
- Aging workforce = higher injury risk + succession planning gap.
- Young workforce = more training load but higher energy.

---

### **15. Employee Years-to-Retirement (Head count against years-to-retire buckets)**

**What does it mean**:  
Predicts workforce churn.

**Why it matters:**  
COOs hate surprises. Knowing retirement waves avoids sudden skill gaps.
